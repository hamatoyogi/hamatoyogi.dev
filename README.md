# Astro

This directory is a brief example of an [Astro](https://astro.build/) site that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Astro project with Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/examples/astro&template=astro)

_Live Example: https://astro-template.vercel.app_

## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components or layouts.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |
