  <p class="mt-10">Hey there 👋🏽, I'm Yoav.</p>
  <p class="mt-10">You can find me all over the web as HamatoYogi.</p>
  <p class="mt-10">
    I've been a computer geek and a techie my entire life. However, my
    professional Internet and startup journey started somewhere in late 2009
    when during my University studies I was the webmaster for the Israeli Museam
    for Comics. Not long after that, I found myself doing SEO, Marketing,
    Ecommerce, consultancy, and oddjob dev work, sometimes as a freelancer
    others as an employee.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-10">
    Later on I went to work at some startups. (you can read more about that in
    the <InternalLink href="/work">work</InternalLink> section). But nowadays I'm
    heading <b>Developer Experience</b> at <ExternalLink
      href="https://builder.io">Builder.io</ExternalLink
    >.
