    <p>Hey there 👋🏽, I'm Yoav.</p>
    <p>You can find me all over the web as HamatoYogi.</p>
    <p>
      I've been a computer geek and a techie my entire life. However, my
      professional Internet and startup journey started somewhere in late 2009
      when during my University studies I was the webmaster for the Israeli
      Museam for Comics. Not long after that, I found myself doing SEO,
      Marketing, Ecommerce, consultancy, and oddjob dev work, sometimes as a
      freelancer others as an employee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on I went to work at several startups and one big company. (you can
      read more about that in the <InternalLink href="/work">work</InternalLink>
      section).
    </p>
    <p>
