    <p class="mt-10">Hey there, I'm Yoav.</p>
    <p class="mt-10">You can find me all over the web as HamatoYogi.</p>
    <p class="mt-10">
      I've been a computer geek and a techie my entire life. However, my
      professional Internet and startup journey started somewhere in late 2009
      when during my University studies I was the webmaster for the Israeli
      Meuseam for Comics. Not long after that, I found myself doing SEO,
      Marketing, Ecommerce, and oddjob dev work, sometimes as a freelancer
      others as an employee.
