title: 'Why I Decided To Build My Site With Astro'

import Layout from '~layouts/Layout.astro';

<Layout title={frontmatter.title} description={`My first blog post on my new site: ${frontmatter.title}`}>
  <main class="px-4 md:px-0 md:mx-[20vw] prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl text-white">
    <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
    It’s been a long time coming… <br/>
    I’ve procrastinated. Started and stopped, changed frameworks and tools - but I’ve finally got my site up!
    My thoughts and trials with [Astro](https://astro.build/) date back a year, when I originally started writing this post, which was at the time just titled “Astro”. However, now that I’ve made the plunge I am happy I can take you through time and bring you this post.
    <h2>It all started on August 30th 2021…</h2>
    Ok, so I just somehow ended up on Astro's website...
    Then I got to a repo by Chris Coyer that looks like this:

  </main>

</Layout>
