      Once again I find myself starting to write about something a little bit
      after the fact... I guess that's just the way I am. However, this time, it
      was a good thing, as I've' had to let some things settle in my head and
      around the the framework state (and not the kind of state that popped into
      your head 😜).
    </p>
    <p>
      The framework I'm talking about (as you can tell by the headline) is <ExternalLink
        href="https://qwik.builder.io/">Qwik</ExternalLink
      > which has just released it's <ExternalLink
        href="https://www.builder.io/blog/qwik-and-qwik-city-have-reached-beta"
        >initial beta</ExternalLink
      > along with "Qwik City", their own meta framework for building Qwik sites/apps.
      It's basically what Next.js is to React.
    </p>
    <section>
      <h2>What is Qwik?</h2>
      <YouTube id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2eF3YLiNhY" />
      <p>
        Qwik is the new buzz worthy framework in town, and rightfully so IMO.
        The 2 key features it brings to the table are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Resumability</li>
        <li>Progressiveness</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        It is built by the team at <ExternalLink href="https://builder.io/"
          >Buider.io</ExternalLink
        >, by an A-team of very well known and respected individuals of the dev
        community: <ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/mhevery"
          >Miško Hevery</ExternalLink
        >, <ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/manucorporat"

        >, and
        <ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/adamdbradley"
          >Adam Bradley</ExternalLink
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Miško used to work at Google for 16 years, and is the man behing
        AngularJS and <ExternalLink href="https://angular.io/"
          >Angular</ExternalLink
        >. Adam and Manu are both behind projects such as <ExternalLink
          href="https://ionic.io/">Ionic</ExternalLink
        >, <ExternalLink href="https://stenciljs.com/">Stencil</ExternalLink>.
        Adam has also recently released <ExternalLink
          href="https://partytown.builder.io/">Party Town 🎉</ExternalLink
        > (also under the Builder umbrella) which helps contain 3rd party scripts
        on your websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gist of what Qwik is trying to solve mostly, is the problem of SSR
        hydration. To better understand why this is one of the frameworks golas,
        I encourage you to read Miško's fantastic post: <ExternalLink
          href="https://www.builder.io/blog/hydration-is-pure-overhead"

        I was lucky enough to be a part of a small workshop that was held in Tel
        Aviv (curtosy of <ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/shai_reznik"
          >Shai Reznik</ExternalLink
        > 🙏🏽) with Miško. In this workshop, Miško dove deep into the motivations
        and implementations behing the framework. It was mind blowing. I was so enthralled
        by it, that I didn't take many notes, but I will try to share some inner
        insights he gave.

        Qwik's approach is to load almost 0 JavaScript. They do this by having
        one single function which is under 1kb, and is in charge of resuming the
        app on the frontend, right where the server stopped it. This allows the
        framework to achieve <code>O(1)</code> time complexity, while minimizing
        TTI (Time To interactive).
      </p>

      <p>
        The way to think about it, is like VM's (Virtual Machines). For example,
        you can start a VM that runs windows, open up a Word doc, and then close
        the VM. When you restart said VM - you resume from the same place - the
        open doc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Qwik starts on the server, does the work, seralizes the app state and
        framework state into HTML (in earlier versions with the help of <code
          >data-attributes</code
        >, now it's all seralized JSON at the bottom of the HTML). Then when the
        response goes down the wire to the browser, all the data is inside the
        HTML and that tiny JS file can resume the excution where the server
        left.

        The problem with most frameworks like Angular, React, Vue, etc. is that
        SSR (Server Side Rendeting) was an after thought. The initial bootup is
        the main issue. In a nutshell, all current frameworks do the same work
        twice - once on the server and then on the client to attach all the
        listeners and stuff it needs to actually be interactive. This is what
        hydration actually is, the client needs to "hydrate" with the framework
        bindings.
      </p>

            target="_blank">It's like baking a cake twice...</a
          >
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        One key way Qwik circumvents this hydration overhead is the "lazy
        loading" strategy. It can also be found natively in the browser on <code
          >img</code
        >
        tags (request the image only when it's close to the viewport). The basic
        idea is not to load something until you need it. However, it's something
        to tinker with and think about. Other frameworks have lazy loading but:
      </p><ul>
        <li>
          They can only lazy load components not currently in the render tree so
          they have to do it eagerly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Their lazy loading can happen only after the framework is loaded where
          as Qwik can do it with just 1kb.
        </li>
        <li>
          They can only lazy load functions not <ExternalLink
            href="https://discord.com/channels/@me/1023158263098916925/1023521645769539584"
            >closures</ExternalLink
          >.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Qwik aims to do most of the work automatically, as lazy loading is at
        it's core. Code is splitted by default and only loaded on interaction.
        Qwik lazy loads closures but only when they are needed for execution.
        Other frameworks lazy load functions to register listeners even if no
        one will ever trigger the listener.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the React ecosystem, to achive code splitting you'd have to do it
        intentionaly by dynamically importing, and need to use something like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the past -
          <ExternalLink
            href="https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#code-splitting"
            ><code>react-loadable</code>
          </ExternalLink>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nowadays -
          <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable"
            ><code>React Lazy</code>
          </ExternalLink> does the trick.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Next.js -
          <ExternalLink
            href="https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import"
            ><code>Dynamic Import</code>
          </ExternalLink>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        Let me try and re-emphasise this point... Let's say you use React Lazy
        for every component, when you build the whole app, these components
        still have to load. Meaning, these components aren't bundled with the
        main app code, and they need to load and hydrate. This actually
        degragades performance.

      <h2>Moar Fetures...</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Reduced Rendering:</b>
            reactivity baked in, minimized rendering and code dowload, starts at
            server - restored in client.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Scalability:</b> the only downloaded code is code the user uses.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Code once:</b> No need to separate server logic from client logic on
          the component level. DOM listeners are setup on server render, and are
          ready on client interactive.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        What's the biggest kick though? Qwik uses <code>JSX</code>, so if you
        know React or Solid, you are going to feel right at home. On top of
        that, reactivity and state managment are baked in.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        So, if you're fed up with moving around code, adding lazy load
        boundries, and knowing that each feature you write is degragading the
        user experiece of your app - Qwik is definitly something to look into.

        These are early days for Qwik, but it sure seems that a lot of folks are
        excited and hyped about it, myself included. The frontend scene has only
        started playing around with the framework, and the Builder team are
        doing some excellent work promoting, explaining, and getting the word
        out.

      <h2>Final Words</h2>
      <p>
        I'm pretty stoked about Qwik, and I hope I was able to convey why you
        should be as well. It seems like the team behind this awesome tehcnology
        has set to fix a lot of the performance problems the web has nowadays.
        Even if you aren't sure or ready to take on learning yet another
        frontend framework, at least know that this sort of endevour is what
        pushes the web forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's at least important to remember where we came from and where things
        are going, so I'll end with one more slide from Miško's deck:
